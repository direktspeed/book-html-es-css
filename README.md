OpenSource Book Introducing Web Application Development with todays Tech.

i will base this book on my "ECMAScript Stealify - Unleash the Power of Encapsulation"

- Why do you would want to insert ; everywhere needed? because if ECMAScript does not find a ; and it errors and retrys it with a ; thats how ; inseration works so better directly have them in place.
